### Learn Coding
Notes from half a year of consuming podcasts, videos, courses, ...
- [ ] Get Django Job Advice (W. Vincent, djangochat 20-06-24 - 34:10): some open source projects you can point to (so people see your code); personal site (documenting your journey; showing that you can communicate & learn); contribute to django or one of the packages (PR in something django related)
- [ ] Get Django Job advice (Djangochat Kalub: 21-06-24 - 38:05): build a network - connect to people who are already in (have at least some form of relationship; (can recommend you) know that you can write django code) - build trust to company (so they know you work there for long)
- [ ] [Get django job (LearnDjango.com](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/how-get-hired-django-developer)
- [ ] Build own Project!!!

- [ ] [Quazi: practical path: learn, teach, build, present, clients,...](https://youtu.be/bjQPxuSUAc4)
- [ ] Quazi: start with freelance teaching for beginners/students (final exam) (35-100$/h) > assignments = challenges which teach you coding + get (online) testimonials(!) to apply for client jobs!
- [ ] Quazi: Build portfolio to show: testimonials and nice photo(!!!) of you (people want to work with humans!) on freelance platforms
- [ ] Quazi: Build portfolio to show #2: website with real world projects + real testimonials (freelance platform feedback, chats, client videos,...) from teaching & client work
- [ ] Quazi & everyone: build real world projects(!) which have a purpose! -> build portfolio!
- [ ] Quazi: find freelance clients (& required skills to specialize(!!) ("lazer-focus on skills required on the job market! Spend time to look @ the market regularly(!); then PLAN YOUR LEARNING around it!)) on freelance platforms + Apply (personalized!! - advice: videoapplication - communication/softskills counts 80%!!)! - start small!
- [ ] Hire freelancers: TO TEACH YOU CERTAIN SKILLS to solve your problems in client work yourself; to learn hiring; find good people to help you get your projects done, outsorcing
- [ ] Sam: improve your Real World Projects by time or build new ones with great purpose after improving your skills for some time! (aka. build products, platforms, services, software, solutions,...)
- [ ] Follow a roadmap! Have clear plan! Go to bootcamp or follow other curriculum
- [ ] Focus on learning one thing at a time
- [ ] Code along with tutorials; look up details/concepts you don't understand; then try to rebuild remembering on your own (as far as possible)
- [ ] Don't try to memorize; rather learn where/how to (re)look up stuff
- [ ] Build RealWorld Projects; if you don't have your own: codementor.io
- [ ] Qazi (Clever Programmer): "look at something you wanna build and kind of model that"
- [ ] Qazi (CSS Crash Course): Better work deeply on one big project (3-6-12 months) then on the surface of different ones
- [ ] Side-Project: build quick&dirty MVP > ship it EARLY! > receive feedback (do people use it, pay for it, need it) > get paid > improve MVP (Simple Programmer 77)
- [ ] Teach as you learn (blogging) to truely understand (SP 83)
- [ ] Talk 10 minutes daily: Reach out to someone who has some connection to coding, business, finance = build a network
- [ ] Watch 10 minutes daily: something related to coding, freelancing, clients, business, Finance
- [ ] Listen 10 minutes daily: To podcast on topic which you want to improve
- [ ] SimpleProgrammer Podcast 105: Eric Smith: "Build something which you need yourself"
- [ ] SPP149: copy to learn - to improve your technique - apply later when your technique is good
- [ ] SPP 117: Repetition. Doing a lot. Start writing code! Create **complete** programs! Force yourself to get out of the comfortzone.
- [ ] [Eddie Jaoude: DevAsAService 2022](https://youtu.be/_ItDG687wC0): create github 2. Learn basic html/css & setup basic html portfolio with github pages 3. learn basic JS and amend portfolio 4. opensource EVERYTHING on github to show your PROGRESS & IMPROVEMENT + to give others opportunity to contribute > use github as social platform & help 4. Help others ("there is always someone 7 days behind you") 5. share at least once a day on twitter (help others, share progress, provide useful info)
- [ ] SPP207: become good quickly by solving other peoples problems (exposes you to wider range of problems than usual programmer) -> alternative to non-sense-socializing at work
